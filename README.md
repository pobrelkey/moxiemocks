==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pobrelkey/moxiemocks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pobrelkey/moxiemocks)

A wicked good mock object framework for Java.  (Currently being ported over from [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/moxiemocks).)

TODO: write a new README; fix that one bug so the Travis build stops failing; get some sleep.
